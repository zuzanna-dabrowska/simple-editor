# Simple save-load editor

Simple toolkit to save your text in local storage and reload it.

## How to use it?

Simply write something in the text area, click on save, later on refresh the page and click load to see your saved text.
By using clear history button, you remove previously saved information.

### In future...

I hope to add any possibility to view history without going to "Application --> Local Storage".
